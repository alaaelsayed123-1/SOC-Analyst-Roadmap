## Networking Advantages vs Disadvantages
### Advantages
- Resource sharing
- Communication between systems
- Centralized management

### Disadvantages
- Security risks
- Network dependency
- Requires management and protection

## Network Components
- Computer System: end devices (PCs, servers)
- Network Media: wired or wireless connections
- Network Interface: NIC used to connect to network
- Network Protocol: rules for communication (e.g., TCP/IP)

## Network Types (Geographical)
- LAN: Local Area Network
- WAN: Wide Area Network
- MAN: Metropolitan Area Network
- WLAN: Wireless LAN

## Host Roles
### Client/Server
- Server provides services
- Client requests services
- Centralized and secure but needs resources

### Peer-to-Peer
- Devices act as both client and server
- Simple but less secure and less scalable

## Network Topologies
### Physical Topology
How devices are physically connected

### Bus Topology
- Single backbone cable
- Uses broadcast communication

### Star Topology
- Central device (switch)
- Most common in modern networks

### Ring Topology
- Devices connected in a loop

### Mesh Topology
- Multiple connections between devices
- High redundancy

## Traffic Types
- Unicast: one-to-one
- Broadcast: one-to-all
- Multicast: one-to-many

## SOC Note
Understanding topology and traffic types helps identify abnormal traffic patterns and attacks.
