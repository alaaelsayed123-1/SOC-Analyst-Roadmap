🌐 Room 4: Networking Basics – MAC Addresses

## What Does MAC Stand For?
- **MAC = Media Access Control**
- Unique identifier for a network interface.

## Practical Example
- Hotel Wi-Fi scenario:
  - Alice’s MAC: allowed (paid user)
  - Bob’s MAC: blocked (non-paying)
  - Changing Bob’s MAC to Alice’s allowed access.

## Key Concept
- Demonstrates **MAC-based access control**.
- Introduces **MAC spoofing** as a security consideration.
